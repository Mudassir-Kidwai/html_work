            forms are quite interesting, we can use color, button, text, password, emails in type.
            Name is used to put any name to work to use it in some other place.
            value and placeholder are just for the user to understand what needs to be filled in the box.
            Submit is also type of input we can submit and use the working from form as an action 
            and with methods of get and posts.
            Required are used for important blocks that are genuinly required. 
            forms take 3 things (Class, Action, Method).
                    <form class = "" action = "" method = ""> </form>
